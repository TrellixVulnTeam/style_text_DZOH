ok never going back to this place again .
easter day nothing open , heard about this place figured it would ok .
the host that walked us to the table and left without a word .
it just gets worse .
the food tasted awful .
no sign of the manager .
the last couple years this place has been going down hill .
last night however it was way to thick and tasteless .
it smelled like rotten urine .
i am not exaggerating .
this smelled bad !
it was obvious it was the same damn one he brought the first time .
i tried to eat it but it was disgusting .
it tasted horrible !
i pushed it aside and did n't eat anymore .
i will never be back .
do yourself a favor and just stay away .
i ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda .
$ _num_ for a soda ?
the total for this lunch was $ _num_ .
